ABSTRACT = {Single-frequency lasers are essential for high-resolution spectroscopy and sensing applications as they combine high-frequency stability with low noise and high output power stability. For many of these applications, there is increasing interest in power-scaling single-frequency sources, both in the near-infrared and visible spectral range. We report the second-harmonic generation of 670 ÂµJ at 532 nm of a single-frequency fiber amplifier signal operating in the quasi-continuous-wave mode in a 10-mm periodically poled Mg-doped lithium niobate (MgO:PPLN) crystal, while increasing compactness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest pulse energy generated in this crystal, which may find applications in the visible and UV such as remote Raman spectroscopy.},
