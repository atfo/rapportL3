abstract = {Second-harmonic generation (SHG) in PPKTP, PPMgSLT, and PPMgLN crystals is analyzed by frequency-doubling CW light from a 1064 nm fiber laser over a range of powers up to 10 W. Data for fundamental powers less than 3 W is used to determine the effects of the fundamental laser linewidth on SHG and to identify imperfections in the periodicity and boundary sharpness of the crystals' poled domains which can reduce SHG. Data for fundamental powers greater than 3 W is used to diagnose and model limiting effects on SHG such as pump depletion and thermal dephasing. Thermal dephasing was found to reduce second-harmonic power by 25\% or more for input fundamental powers approaching 10 W.},

ABSTRACT = {Single-frequency lasers are essential for high-resolution spectroscopy and sensing applications as they combine high-frequency stability with low noise and high output power stability. For many of these applications, there is increasing interest in power-scaling single-frequency sources, both in the near-infrared and visible spectral range. We report the second-harmonic generation of 670 ÂµJ at 532 nm of a single-frequency fiber amplifier signal operating in the quasi-continuous-wave mode in a 10-mm periodically poled Mg-doped lithium niobate (MgO:PPLN) crystal, while increasing compactness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest pulse energy generated in this crystal, which may find applications in the visible and UV such as remote Raman spectroscopy.},
